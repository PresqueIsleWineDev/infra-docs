# Helpdesk Implementation

I intend on allowing users to use the avenue of their choice to communicate their issues to system administration.

Given all of the code & documentation is hosted on GitHub,
I plan to use GitHub Issues as the backend to track & manage requests, error reports, etc.

Later, I will try to integrate other communication methods with GitHub issues.

I will encourage users to directly create issues as my preferred method of requesting support,
but will likely continue to support other communication methods like email, Teams messages, phone calls, and SMS.

## GitHub Issues Features

- Allows me to reference specific issues in code/config changes and the changelogs of new releases.
- Allows status reporting of the progress/status of an issue.
- Allows users to post files, screenshots, error logs, etc. in their description of an issue.
- Allows users to apply tags to their issue to express catagorization & urgency.
- Allows anyone in the company to see what issues are solved, what are still open, and what is in the backlog.
- Allows anyone in the company to reply to issues, submit feedback, etc.
- Closed issues can be re-opened if some solution doesn't solve their problems.
- Can be configured to send me emails & perform other tasks when a user posts or updates an issue.
- Provides template support for common types of issues. I will create some for expected common issues.
- Integrates with Microsoft Teams for easily creating an Issue from a message in Teams.

## Issue Filing Process

Users can directly file issues themselves by:

- Creating a GitHub account by signing in using their Microsoft account
- Clicking the `Issues` tab then `New Issue`
